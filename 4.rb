# Binary Search Tree Challenge
#
# insert and search for numbers in a binary tree.
#
# when we need to represent sorted data, an array does not make a good
# data structure.
#
# say we have the array `[1, 3, 4, 5]`, and we add 2 to it so it becomes
# `[1, 3, 4, 5, 2]` now we must sort the entire array again! We can
# improve on this by realizing that we only need to make space for the new
# item `[1, nil, 3, 4, 5]`, and then adding the item in the space we
# added. but this still requires us to shift many elements down by one.
# 
# binary search trees, however, can operate on sorted data much more
# efficiently.
# 
# a binary search tree consists of a series of connected nodes. Each node
# contains a piece of data (e.g. the number 3), a variable named `left`,
# and a variable named `right`. The `left` and `right` variables point at
# `nil`, or other nodes. Since these other nodes in turn have other nodes
# beneath them, we say that the left and right variables are pointing at
# subtrees. all data in the left subtree is less than or equal to the
# current node's data, and all data in the right subtree is greater than
# the current node's data.
# 
# for example, if we had a node containing the data 4, and we added the
# data 2, our tree would look like this:
# 
#      4
#     /
#    2
# 
# if we then added 6, it would look like this:
#
#      4
#     / \
#    2   6
#
# if we then added 3, it would look like this
#
#       4
#     /   \
#    2     6
#     \
#      3
#
# and if we then added 1, 5, and 7, it would look like this
#
#          4
#        /   \
#       /     \
#      2       6
#     / \     / \
#    1   3   5   7
